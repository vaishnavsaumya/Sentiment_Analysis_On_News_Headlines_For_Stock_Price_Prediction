# Sentiment_Analysis_On_News_Headlines_For_Stock_Price_Prediction
This is a graduate course project for the course MIE1520 : Learning with Graphs and Sequences done in Winter 2024 at University of Toronto

There are two Python Notebooks, one for Data Collection and one for Model Training.

Things to be noted:
1) The Dataset files are named as feb_march_... , however, they contain data for feb, march AND april. The naming is incoherent as the the final dataset was generated by concatenating various versions of previously scraped data.
2) The final dataset used for the project is available in the files titled : "feb_march_Apple_stocks_6.csv", "feb_march_Headlines_English_Apple_Market_Time_6", "feb_march_Headlines_English_Apple_Market_Time_Final_6.csv" and "feb_march_Headlines_English_Apple_Market_Time_Sentiment_6.csv"
